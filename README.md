# java-001-drills

This repository contains drills and their solutions for Thinkful's *JAVA-001: Programming fudnamentals in Java* curriculum.

## For learners

The `master` branch of this repository contains a folder for each drill in the curriculum. For each drill, you'll find a Markdown file that contains a description of the requirements for the drill, along with any scaffolding to complete the drill (note that not all drills have scaffolding).

In the `solutions` branch of this repository, you'll find example solutions for each drill. As a learner, you're on the honor system here: we ask that you hold off on looking at any solutions until you've put in a good faith effort at solving the drill on your own.

## For curriculum contributors

If you're a contributor to this project, here's what you need to know:

For each drill you create, add an appropriately named folder. Inside this folder, add a README.md file that contains instructions and requirements the student will need to complete the drill. If there is any scaffolding supplied for the drill, it should go in this new folder as well.  In short, everything a learner would need to get going on the drill should be contained in the folder for the drill. **All of this should happen in the `master` branch**.

As a contributor, you also should create example solutions for each drill. Working solutions should be put in the folder for the drill, **but in the `solutions` branch of this repo**.  

Solutions should follow all best practices and coding style guidlines we teach in the course. They should also feature extensive commenting to aid learners in reading through the solution.
