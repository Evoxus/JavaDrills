# java-001-drills

This repository contains drills and their solutions for Thinkful's *JAVA-001: Programming fudnamentals in Java* curriculum.

The `master` branch of this repository contains a folder for each drill in the curriculum. For each drill, you'll find a Markdown file that contains a description of the requirements for the drill, along with any scaffolding to complete the drill (note that not all drills have scaffolding).

In the `solutions` branch of this repository, you'll find example solutions for each drill. As a learner, you're on the honor system here: we ask that you hold off on looking at any solutions until you've put in a good faith effort at solving the drill on your own.
