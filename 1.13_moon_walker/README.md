# 1.12 Moon walker

Write a program that prompts for the userâ€™s weight in pounds, then using the force of gravity formula 

    $$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
    
where $$F$$ is the force of gravity, $$G =6.67408 \times 10^{-11} m^{3}kg^{-1}s^{-2}$$ is the gravitational constant, $$m_1 = 7.35 \times 10^{22} kg$$ is the mass of the Moon, $$r = 1737.5 km$$ is the radius of the Moon and $$m_2$$ is your weight in kg.
    
Calculate the weight of the user on the moon. It will be necessary to convert pounds to kilograms first and values such as gravitational constant and mass of Moon are provided.
