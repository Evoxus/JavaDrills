# 4.5 DRY up with inheritance

Clone this repository and navigate to the drill 4.5 folder. 

```bash
  cd 4.5_dry_up_with_inheritance
```

This folder contains several classes found in the __src__ directory that are fully implemented . However,there is some duplication of code involved. Refactor the code using inheritance and composition to avoid duplication of code where possible. All tests should continue to pass.

To run the tests

```bash
  gradle test
```
